        "excerpt":"Phew, just finished the basic setup of my brand-new blog-site. It took almost five hours to get here. Working with Octopress was fun. Setting up a blog on commandline is way cooler than doing it the wordpress style. Of course, Octopress drew me to itself with its subtitle:  A blogging framework for hackers.I noticed Divya Manian move her blog to Octopress. After looking up Octopress and what people feel about it (everyone seems to like it), I decided to try it myself.After reading almost all of the Octopress site, I cloned the Octopress repo, setup a Disqus account for the site and plugged in account into the config files. All commands are run through rake, which makes it as easy as:rake new_page[page_title]   # create a new page  rake new_post[post_title]   # create a new post  rake preview                # fire up a local server and preview the site at localhost:4000  rake deploy                 # Make it live! :)Just now realized that syntax highlighting breaks on Windows. Gotta find a fix for it soon. The Google Fonts were making the pages render slower, so I am thinking if they should be removed. The styles look good, but will spend some time on the CSS and fiddle around with it. Compass and SASS are new to me, more CSS frameworks to learn :(.That’s it folks for now, will update with more changes I am planning to the site.","categories": [],

        "title": "Demystifying Butterknife",
        "excerpt":"Reading source code, especially of the programs and libraries you use, is quite useful in understanding how it is built. Sometimes, it’d be helpful if one can explained how code is structured and how to deconstruct it. Here is my attempt at writing down my thoughts on Butterknife code, which can potentially help new developers.In this post, we will be uncovering the magic and provide a commentary on the library.Butterknife is majorly composed of three pieces  annotations  annotation processor  runtime libraryAnnotationsDefines all the BindView annotation and the like that you use in view code. You can see them all here.400: Invalid requestAnnotation processorThis is the most interesting part of Butterknife. The implementation is simple(ish). The processor says it’s interested in all the Butterknife annotations. Then the compiler calls the processor with all the elements annotated with these annotations.  It creates the XActivity_ViewBinding class. Let’s focus on the BindView annotation, others behave similarly (listeners are slightly different). The crux of parseBindView is in lines 475-499.400: Invalid requestHere is a sample _ViewBinding class generated by the processor.400: Invalid requestListeners are implemented with little more complexity, mainly in parseListenerAnnotation, specifically lines 1139-1164 and 1204-1213. If we skip all the error-checking, the method parseListenerAnnotation matches the parameters from the Android listener which are used in the bound method and passes off the required params to BindingSet.Builder#addMethod.400: Invalid requestSee Jake Wharton’s talk on Annotation Processor to get more details of how one is built.Runtime libraryThis is a utility library and some sugar. The utilities are used from the generated code and the Butterknife class. When you call Butterknife.bind(), it reflectively loads the processor-generated class, which is named your-view-class-name + \"_ViewBinding\" and constructs an instance of the class.400: Invalid requestThe Butterknife class is not really required to make use of the binder. In fact, it adds runtime reflection cost. You can instead use the generated class directly. This is the approach Dagger 2 has taken as well.400: Invalid requestBonus: The Gradle pluginThe gradle plugin has a very simple function. It lets you use Butterknife in library modules. But why can’t you use Butterknife in library modules like regular application modules? Because the element value in an annotation can only be a constant value for primitive types12. But the R class generated by Android Gradle plugin doesn’t make the ID values constant in library modules. If libraries had their resource IDs final, then the IDs could collide when building the final apk. So your compile step will complain loudly if you write@BindView(R.id.viewid) View idView;You could not use Butterknife in library modules earlier, that is until Gautam Korlam contributed a Gradle plugin which clones R as R2 with final values for resources. Now you can use @BindView(R2.id.viewid) View idView in library modules without worry. Most of the interesting work is done in the class FinalRClassBuilder.400: Invalid requestIn addition, there’s a module for Android lint checks which I’m not covering here.Would readers be interested in a walk through building a basic version of Butterknife from scratch?Thanks to Yashasvi Girdhar for reading drafts of the post.            https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.28 &#8617;              https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-9.html#jls-ElementValue &#8617;      ","categories": [],
