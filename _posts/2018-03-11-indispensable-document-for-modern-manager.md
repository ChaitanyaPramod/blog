excerpt: User guide is one of the most powerful ideas for managers
---
I love the idea of writing a user guide on oneself. As a manager, you can share your thoughts, expectations, style of communication, personality as relevant for team members. This is extremely scalable and quite valuable to self and team members. Some of the questions from team can be answered right here, thus avoiding synchronous discussions.
