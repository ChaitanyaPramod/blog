excerpt: Historically significant document proposing Dagger 2 design from Greg Kick
---
Found this beatiful document from Greg Kick making a proposal for fully statically resolved dependency injection framework on Dagger 1 Github issues.

This proposal is historically significant as it brings in a new generation of java dependency injection framework which is completely code generated. This avoids reflection altogether which is expensive in terms of CPU cycles (and much more so on Android).
